# Predicting-Engineering-Grades-with-Machine-Learning

Project Overview
This project aims to predict student grades in GCSE-level engineering subjects at WMG Academy using advanced machine learning models. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can help educators and institutions anticipate student performance and intervene effectively. By analyzing historical student data and applying various models, this project provides insights into the effectiveness of machine learning in educational contexts, particularly for subjects that integrate theoretical and practical knowledge like engineering.

Models Used
Several machine learning models were employed to predict student grades, including:

Neural Networks: Achieved the highest predictive accuracy after tuning, demonstrating its strength in handling complex, non-linear relationships.
Random Forest: Provided a strong baseline for comparison but underperformed in comparison to neural networks.
Lasso and Ridge Regression: Used to control model complexity and regularize the predictions, ensuring that simpler models were also evaluated.
Each model was rigorously tested to evaluate its ability to generalize from the training data and make accurate predictions on unseen data.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Data preprocessing played a crucial role in improving the performance of the models. Techniques used include:

Normalisation: Ensured that all features contributed equally to the model's predictions, particularly important given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student performance.
Feature Engineering: Involved creating additional features such as polynomial terms and applying log transformations to stabilize variance and improve model performance.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Used to reduce dimensionality and mitigate multicollinearity, enhancing the robustness of the models.
Key Findings
Neural Networks consistently outperformed other models, showing superior accuracy and generalization capabilities, especially after hyperparameter tuning.
The study demonstrated the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in improving model performance.
Results suggest that while simpler models like Random Forests and regression techniques provide useful benchmarks, advanced models like Neural Networks are better suited for complex educational data.
Significance of the Project
This project contributes to the field of educational data mining by providing a framework for predicting student performance in interdisciplinary subjects like engineering. By leveraging machine learning, the project provides a tool for educators to better understand student performance trends and potential areas for intervention. It also underscores the necessity of using well-tuned, advanced models and properly preprocessed data to ensure the best predictive outcomes.
