# Predicting-Engineering-Grades-with-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learning model to predict GCSE engineering grades at WMG Academy. Applied Neural Networks, Random Forest, Lasso, and Ridge Regression, with Neural Networks leading in accuracy. Focused on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and tuning. Curious minds welcomeâ€”let's chat! Neural network jokes included.
